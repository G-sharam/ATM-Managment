# ATM-Managment
An ATM Management System in Java is a console-based application that allows users to perform basic banking operations like checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing funds, and changing PIN. It ensures secure user authentication using account numbers and PINs, manages account balances, and processes transactions, all via a simple text-based interface.
